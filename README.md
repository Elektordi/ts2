## Status
TS2 is beta software, meaning it is playable, but still lacks many features that one would expect from a real simulation, will it ever be finished.
When starting TS2, you will be able to download simulations from our [ts2-data](https://github.com/ts2/ts2-data) server.

New simulations can be created with the editor provided with ts2.

## Installation
.. This is 0.7 branch and a TODO later
